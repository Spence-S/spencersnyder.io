# My First Post

So this is the first post on my new gatsby website! I am booting up this site for numerous reasons. My old site was built on - which I am keeping up for fun legacy purposes on github.io - was built with Jekyll. While Jekyll its self was nice to build on - I have wanted to dabble with a site that is more modern than
what I have been working on. Hence, the new site built on Gatsby 2.0!

Gatsby itself is quite wonderful, and extremely powerful once you get the hang of it and I plan myself to be writing a few articles that will extend some of the tutorials in the gatsby sites and dive head first in to some of the cooler and more powerful things that can be done on the gatsby platform.
